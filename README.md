# Image-to-Braille
This program converts the input image into Braille Unicode.

Generally, it was developed to decorate the information box of the steam profile, but it can be made in different sizes for different uses.

For steam profile applications, I recommend using mask mode for grayscale, 
but if you are looking for large size braille, consider the sobel mask too.
